# SmartMask: Real-Time & Image-Based Face Mask Classifier

Face mask classification using MobileNetV2 and Streamlit.

---

## Overview

This project contains two Streamlit web apps for face mask detection:

- **Image Classification App** (`app/app.py`): Upload an image to classify whether a person is wearing a mask properly, not wearing a mask, or wearing it incorrectly.
- **Real-Time Webcam App** (`app/realtime_app.py`): Use your webcam for live face mask detection with face bounding boxes and color-coded labels.

Both apps use a MobileNetV2-based TensorFlow model for classification.
